# qb-customs
Modified version of the qb-customs for QbCore.

1) Has logs for each business (mechanic) + a logging for all logs, so you can allow mechanic businesses to have their own separate logs to see when an employee uses pad and charges society, and also have logs for admins to check all mechanics.

2) Have societies/ jobs where employees or jobs do not get charged, such as police.

3) Added 16 new Chameleon Colours in your fivem server.

Instructions for logs:
Logs for individual mechanic owners can be found locations.lua. Allow them to send a webhook to you and place it on for them for their private discords!

Logs for Gov/ Admin RP Server. In config.lua, Config.AdminLogsWebhook, sends webhooks across for all mechanics.
